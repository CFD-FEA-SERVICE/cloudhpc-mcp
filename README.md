# cloudHPC MCP server

Run engineering simulations on [cloudHPC](https://cloudhpc.cloud) from AI assistants
that support the Model Context Protocol (MCP): Claude, ChatGPT/Codex, Gemini,
GitHub Copilot and others, from their desktop apps, terminal apps and, where
supported, web apps. Inspect a local case, get vCPU/RAM advice, upload the
folder, launch, monitor, diagnose errors and download the results, all from a
conversation.

Supported solvers: everything available on cloudHPC (FDS, OpenFOAM,
snappyHexMesh, DAFoam, code_aster, CalculiX, OpenRadioss, SU2, openTELEMAC,
LIGGGHTS, OpenLB, EnergyPlus, CONTAM, ...). Resource advice
follows the [cloudHPC scalability rules](https://docs.cloudhpc.cloud/scalability/)
and run diagnosis follows the [cloudHPC errors guide](https://docs.cloudhpc.cloud/errors/).

## What you can ask

- *"Check the FDS case in this folder and tell me which resources to use."*
- *"Run it on cloudHPC and download the results when it finishes."*
- *"What is the status of my running simulations?"*
- *"My last run failed: what went wrong?"*

## Safe first prompts

Start with questions that only read data, then move on to actions that cost
money once you are comfortable with how the assistant works:

1. *"How do I prepare an OpenFOAM case for cloudHPC?"* (no account needed)
2. *"List my last simulations and summarise their status."*
3. *"Why did my last simulation fail? Check the log."*
4. *"Which vCPU and RAM type should I use for an FDS model with 8 meshes and 2
   million cells?"*
5. *"What is in the storage folder of my last run, and which files are results?"*

Only then: *"Upload this case and launch it"*, *"Resume simulation 1234"*. Every
action that costs money or deletes data asks for your confirmation first, and
the assistant shows you what it will do. With OAuth sign-in you can also
connect with **read-only access** (see [Sign-in with OAuth](#sign-in-with-oauth)).

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `inspect_case` ¹ | Detect solver and model size of a local folder (FDS meshes/MPI groups, OpenFOAM cells, CalculiX nodes, ...) and run pre-flight checks |
| `suggest_resources` | vCPU and RAM type recommendation, with reasoning |
| `solver_guide` | How to prepare a case for a solver: input files, what cloudHPC does automatically, restart, optional settings, parallelism, logs |
| `list_solvers`, `list_machine_options` | Available solvers, vCPU counts and RAM types |
| `upload_folder` ¹ | Compress a local case folder and upload it to your storage |
| `launch_simulation` | Launch a run (**asks for confirmation**) |
| `list_simulations`, `get_simulation`, `wait_for_simulation` | Follow your runs; finished runs include a diagnosis of known errors |
| `sync_simulation` | Upload partial results of a running job |
| `stop_simulation` | Soft or hard stop (**asks for confirmation**) |
| `resume_simulation` | Resume a stopped run with the same solver, vCPU, RAM type and folder (FDS and OpenFOAM; **asks for confirmation**) |
| `start_desktop` | Start a Linux or Windows remote desktop for post-processing; billed until you stop it (**asks for confirmation**) |
| `open_remote_desktop` | Browser remote-desktop link of a running job |
| `list_storage`, `list_results` | Browse your storage and result archives |
| `download_results` ¹ | Download result archives and extract them locally |
| `get_upload_link`, `get_download_link` | Temporary links to upload/download single files |
| `delete_storage` | Delete a file or folder (**asks for confirmation**) |
| `api_usage` | API rate limits and calls used |

Actions that cost money or delete data (launching a run, a hard stop,
deleting from storage) always need your confirmation. In apps that support it
(e.g. Claude Code) the server shows you a confirmation dialog directly, so the
assistant cannot confirm on your behalf; in other apps the assistant shows you
a summary and waits for your OK.

¹ Only with the local installation: they work on files on your computer. In web
apps (hosted endpoint) use `get_upload_link` / `get_download_link` instead.

## Installation

Requirements:

- Python 3.10 or newer
- A cloudHPC account and its API key: open your cloudHPC profile page
  ([APIKEY docs](https://docs.cloudhpc.cloud/APIKEY/)). The key gives full access
  to your account: keep it private.

Install with [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io) (recommended: isolated, and the
command ends up in `~/.local/bin`, easy to find for desktop apps):

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/CFD-FEA-SERVICE/cloudhpc-mcp
```

or with pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/CFD-FEA-SERVICE/cloudhpc-mcp
```

This installs the `cloudhpc-mcp` command. Find its full path, you may need it
below:

```bash
which cloudhpc-mcp          # Linux / macOS
where cloudhpc-mcp          # Windows
```

The API key is read from the `CLOUDHPC_APIKEY` environment variable or, if that
is not set, from the file `~/.cfscloudhpc/apikey` created by
[cloudHPCexec](https://github.com/CFD-FEA-SERVICE/CloudHPC/tree/master/exampleAPI).

## Connect your AI assistant

There are two ways to connect:

- **Local installation** (desktop and terminal apps): the server runs on your
  computer, so it can read your case folders and save results next to them. All
  tools are available. Recommended.
- **Hosted endpoint** (web apps): `https://mcp.cloudhpc.cloud/mcp`, nothing to
  install. You connect by signing in once with your API key (OAuth) or by
  sending the key in a header. It cannot read files on your computer: you
  upload cases and download results with temporary links (or from the cloudHPC
  web app). See [Web apps](#web-apps-hosted-endpoint).

| Assistant | Desktop app | Terminal (Linux) | Web app |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude | [Claude Desktop](#claude-desktop) (Windows, macOS, Linux beta) | [Claude Code](#claude-code) | [claude.ai](#claudeai) (custom connector) |
| ChatGPT | [ChatGPT desktop app](#chatgpt-desktop-app) (where MCP servers are available) | [Codex CLI](#codex-cli) | [ChatGPT](#chatgpt-web) (OAuth sign-in) |
| Gemini | not supported: no Gemini desktop app with MCP support | [Gemini CLI](#gemini-cli) | [Gemini](#gemini-web) (OAuth sign-in) |
| GitHub Copilot | [VS Code (Copilot agent mode)](#vs-code-copilot-agent-mode) | [Copilot CLI](#copilot-cli) | not supported |

In every example replace `your-api-key` with your key. If the assistant cannot
find the `cloudhpc-mcp` command, write its full path instead (see
[Installation](#installation)).

### Claude

#### Claude Desktop

Open **Settings > Developer > Edit Config** and add the server to
`claude_desktop_config.json`:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Linux: use **Edit Config** to open the file

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloudhpc": {
      "command": "cloudhpc-mcp",
      "env": { "CLOUDHPC_APIKEY": "your-api-key" }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. The cloudHPC tools appear in the tools menu of a new
conversation.

#### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user cloudhpc -e CLOUDHPC_APIKEY=your-api-key -- cloudhpc-mcp
```

`--scope user` makes it available in every folder. Check it with `claude mcp list`
or `/mcp` inside Claude Code.

### ChatGPT / Codex

#### ChatGPT desktop app

In recent versions of the ChatGPT desktop app: **Settings > MCP servers > Add
server**, choose **STDIO**:

- Command: `cloudhpc-mcp`
- Environment variable: `CLOUDHPC_APIKEY` = `your-api-key`

The app shares its MCP configuration with Codex (`~/.codex/config.toml`, see
below), so a server added in one is available in the other. Availability
depends on app version and plan. The ChatGPT **web** app only supports remote
connectors and cannot run this local server.

#### Codex CLI

```bash
codex mcp add cloudhpc --env CLOUDHPC_APIKEY=your-api-key -- cloudhpc-mcp
```

or edit `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.cloudhpc]
command = "cloudhpc-mcp"
tool_timeout_sec = 1900        # wait_for_simulation can wait up to 30 minutes

[mcp_servers.cloudhpc.env]
CLOUDHPC_APIKEY = "your-api-key"
```

Check it with `codex mcp list`.

### Gemini

#### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini mcp add -s user -e CLOUDHPC_APIKEY=your-api-key cloudhpc cloudhpc-mcp
```

or edit `~/.gemini/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloudhpc": {
      "command": "cloudhpc-mcp",
      "env": { "CLOUDHPC_APIKEY": "$CLOUDHPC_APIKEY" },
      "timeout": 1900000
    }
  }
}
```

`$CLOUDHPC_APIKEY` takes the key from your shell (`export CLOUDHPC_APIKEY=...`);
`timeout` (milliseconds) lets `wait_for_simulation` wait up to 30 minutes.
Check it with `/mcp` inside Gemini CLI.

The Gemini desktop and web apps do not support custom MCP servers.

### GitHub Copilot

#### VS Code (Copilot agent mode)

Run **MCP: Open User Configuration** from the Command Palette (or create
`.vscode/mcp.json` in a project) and add:

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    { "type": "promptString", "id": "cloudhpc-key",
      "description": "cloudHPC API key", "password": true }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "cloudhpc": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "cloudhpc-mcp",
      "env": { "CLOUDHPC_APIKEY": "${input:cloudhpc-key}" }
    }
  }
}
```

VS Code asks for the key once and stores it securely. Open Copilot Chat in
**Agent** mode and enable the cloudHPC tools from the tools picker.

#### Copilot CLI

Edit `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloudhpc": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": "cloudhpc-mcp",
      "args": [],
      "env": { "CLOUDHPC_APIKEY": "your-api-key" },
      "tools": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

or use `/mcp add` inside a Copilot CLI session. The Microsoft Copilot app for
Windows does not support custom MCP servers.

### Other MCP clients

Configure a **stdio** server with command `cloudhpc-mcp` and the environment
variable `CLOUDHPC_APIKEY`.

### Web apps (hosted endpoint)

Endpoint: `https://mcp.cloudhpc.cloud/mcp` (streamable HTTP). Two ways to
authenticate:

- **Sign in with OAuth** (ChatGPT, Gemini, claude.ai and any client that
  supports OAuth for MCP servers): see [Sign-in with OAuth](#sign-in-with-oauth).
- **API key header**: the client sends your key with every request in the
  `X-API-Key` header (or `Authorization: Bearer <key>`). The endpoint stores
  nothing: the key is only forwarded to the cloudHPC API for that request.

What changes compared with the local installation:

- `inspect_case`, `upload_folder` and `download_results` are not available: the
  hosted server cannot see your computer.
- To upload a case, compress the **content** of the case folder (files at the
  root of the archive) and ask the assistant for an upload link
  (`get_upload_link`): it gives you a ready `curl` command. Or upload it from
  the cloudHPC web app.
- To get results, ask for a download link (`get_download_link`).

#### Sign-in with OAuth

When you add the connector with OAuth, the assistant opens a cloudHPC sign-in
page:

1. Check the name of the app asking for access. It will be able to see your
   simulations and storage, upload files and **launch or stop simulations,
   which are billed to your account**.
2. Paste your API key ([how to find your API key](https://docs.cloudhpc.cloud/APIKEY/)).
3. Optionally tick **Read-only access**: the assistant can then see simulations,
   storage and results, but cannot launch, stop, resume, upload, delete or open
   remote desktops. Useful to try the connector safely, or for colleagues who
   only need to follow the runs.
4. Click **Connect**.

The assistant never sees the key: it receives tokens that expire after one
hour and are renewed automatically for 30 days, then you sign in again. To
revoke access for every connected assistant, regenerate the API key in your
cloudHPC profile: access stops within an hour.

#### claude.ai

On plans with custom connectors: **Settings > Connectors > Add custom
connector**, URL `https://mcp.cloudhpc.cloud/mcp`, then either:

- leave the authentication on OAuth and sign in when asked
  ([Sign-in with OAuth](#sign-in-with-oauth)), or
- choose **No sign-in** and under **Request headers** add
  `X-API-Key` = `your-api-key`.

Enable the connector in a conversation from the tools menu. The same connector
is also available in the Claude desktop and mobile apps.

#### ChatGPT web

In ChatGPT, turn on developer mode and add a custom connector (app):

- URL: `https://mcp.cloudhpc.cloud/mcp`
- Authentication: **OAuth**

Then sign in on the cloudHPC page ([Sign-in with OAuth](#sign-in-with-oauth)).

#### Gemini web

In the Gemini app (gemini.google.com):

1. Click **Customise** in the left sidebar.
2. Open the **Connectors** tab.
3. Click **+ Custom**, enter the URL `https://mcp.cloudhpc.cloud/mcp` and click
   **Next**.
4. Sign in on the cloudHPC page that opens
   ([Sign-in with OAuth](#sign-in-with-oauth)).

Gemini registers itself automatically: you do not need an OAuth client ID or
secret. The connector then appears under **Connected apps**.

#### Copilot web

Microsoft Copilot and Copilot Chat on github.com do not support custom MCP
servers.

#### Other clients using the hosted endpoint

Any MCP client that supports streamable HTTP with custom headers works, for
example:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http cloudhpc https://mcp.cloudhpc.cloud/mcp \
  --header "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
```

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "cloudhpc": {
    "httpUrl": "https://mcp.cloudhpc.cloud/mcp",
    "headers": { "X-API-Key": "your-api-key" } } } }
```

(the second is the Gemini CLI format; VS Code uses `"type": "http"`, `"url"`
and `"headers"`; Codex CLI uses `url` and `http_headers` in `config.toml`).

## Good to know

- **Upload layout**: the content of the case folder is archived at the root of
  `upload.tar.gz` and uploaded into a storage folder with the same name as the
  local folder. Hidden files are skipped. Folder names must not contain
  `, ( ) ' $ ~ " #` or spaces.
- **Resources**: FDS, CalculiX and code_aster start on `highcpu`; after a memory
  error move to `standard`, then `highmem`. OpenFOAM and other MPI-only solvers
  use `highcore` or `hypercore`. 1 vCPU on `highcpu` is never suggested for a
  solver: it has too little RAM to start.
- **Checking runs**: a run can end as COMPLETED even if the solver failed. When
  a run ends the server scans its output for the errors listed in the
  [errors guide](https://docs.cloudhpc.cloud/errors/) and suggests the fix;
  after downloading, it also checks the solver's own logs (OpenFOAM `log.*`,
  FDS `.out`).
- **Costs** are billed per vCPU-hour and shown in euro when a run ends.
- **Storage**: files are deleted automatically 60 days after creation. Download
  your results.
- **Rate limits**: 100 API calls/hour on free accounts, 500 on full accounts (no daily limit).
  The server reads the rate-limit headers and stops before exceeding them.
- **Your data**: what the tools return (simulation names, logs, file lists,
  costs) is sent to the AI provider of the assistant you use, under your own
  account and its terms. For confidential projects check your provider's data
  settings (e.g. training opt-out, business plans). With the local installation
  your API key stays on your computer; the hosted endpoint only forwards it and
  stores nothing. With OAuth sign-in the assistant only holds encrypted,
  expiring tokens, not the key.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| The assistant does not see the cloudHPC tools | Restart the app after editing its configuration; in terminal apps check with `/mcp` or `mcp list`. |
| `command not found` / server fails to start | Use the full path of `cloudhpc-mcp` (`which cloudhpc-mcp`). Desktop apps do not load your shell's PATH, conda or virtual environments. |
| `Unauthorized: the API key is invalid` | Copy the key again from your cloudHPC profile page. |
| Hosted endpoint: `Invalid header name` | Write the header exactly as `X-API-Key: your-api-key` (name, colon, space, key). |
| Sign-in page: "The API key was not accepted" | Copy the key again from your profile ([how to find it](https://docs.cloudhpc.cloud/APIKEY/)); paste only the key, without spaces. |
| The assistant asks for an OAuth client ID and secret | Remove the connector and add it again with the URL `https://mcp.cloudhpc.cloud/mcp`: it registers automatically, no client ID or secret is needed. |
| The assistant asks you to sign in again | Normal after 30 days, or after you regenerated the API key: sign in with the current key. |
| `rate limit reached` | Wait for the next hour, or ask the assistant to check less often. |
| The wait for a run is cut off | Raise the tool timeout of your client (see the examples above) or ask the assistant to wait in shorter steps. |

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CFD-FEA-SERVICE/cloudhpc-mcp
cd cloudhpc-mcp
pip install -e ".[test]"
pytest            # offline tests with a mocked API
```

Server modes (`CLOUDHPC_MCP_MODE`):

| Mode | Transport | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `local` (default) | stdio | Desktop and terminal apps on your computer |
| `remote` | streamable HTTP | Hosted endpoint; the API key comes with each request |
| `remote` + OAuth | streamable HTTP | Set `CLOUDHPC_OAUTH_SECRET` (random value; comma-separated list to rotate) and `CLOUDHPC_PUBLIC_URL` (public base URL): adds OAuth 2.1 sign-in (PKCE, dynamic client registration and client ID metadata documents) where the user pastes the API key on a server page; tokens are encrypted, nothing is stored. Requests without credentials get `401` with the OAuth challenge; `X-API-Key` keeps working |
| `public` | streamable HTTP | Key-less guide endpoint (e.g. for a website chat bot): only `solver_guide`, `list_solvers`, `list_machine_options`, `suggest_resources`. The solver and machine catalog is read with the key in `CLOUDHPC_CATALOG_APIKEY` (a dedicated account with no data) and cached for `CLOUDHPC_CATALOG_TTL` seconds (default 3600); requests are limited to `CLOUDHPC_PUBLIC_RATE_PER_MIN` per client IP (default 60) |

`scripts/e2e_test.py` runs the whole workflow against the real API with your
account: it uploads a tiny FDS case and, with `--confirm-costs`, runs it on
1 vCPU for about a minute (`--no-launch` only uploads; `--cleanup` deletes the
test folder at the end).
